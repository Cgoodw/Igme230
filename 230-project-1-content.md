  ## I- Concept
  While being chased by a tiger, the player must navigate a 2D platformer full of traps and slowdowns.

  ## II- Genre
  An infinite runner with 2D platformer elements
  
__III- Desktop and Mobile Friendly__
   
  ## IV-Story
After stealing a valuable relic from a cave deep in the rainforest, you seem to awaken a wild tiger.  She gives chase and with your head start you must stay alive by not slowing down too much.  The fearful mood throughout is enhanced by the stressful, randomly-generated, traps throughout the jungle, left by local tribes or just hazards of the woods.  The goal is to get as far as possible and achieve a high score. 
  ## Esthetics
Abstract, potentially 16-bit graphics with cartoonish sounds and 8bit, looping music.  The UI is all cartoony as well with a long, looping background and a randomly created path set infront of you.

  ## VI-Gameplay
  The Player is on a constant run to the right of the screen, staying centered in the camera the whole way.  Spacebar to jump and Click to interact with things (rope swings, levers, etc.)  On mobile these would be replaced with a tap on the screen and a press and hold on the screen.  THe player will be taught on their first runthrough with in game, live tutorials.  AS they apporach their first jump it wil explain what to do.  There will be larger jumps, harder swings, and other areas of ramped up difficulty, but it is mostly challenging based on consistent timing.

_This game is very easy to learn and as of now, impossible to beat.  The highest score wins and that's the appeal.  With simple controls it should allow for infinite gameplay._
